          A core part of the Azuki brand is storytelling. I helped design the
          brand&apos;s lore initiative. A huge collaborative effort across all
          parts of the Azuki team, we placed a huge emphasis on user exploration
          by thoughtfully sequencing copy, animation, and art.
