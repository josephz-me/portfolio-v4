          Tools shape the way we express ourselves and share our ideas. From
          Microsoft Paint to more complex tools such as Adobe Photoshop, the
          affordances of creative applications heavily influence the way we
          create. Pixel Push is a collaborative painting experience that
          reimagines art in the digital space through experimentation with audio
          recognition and webcam image-capture. Instead of solid hex code or RGB
          values, users paint with webcam video and the microphone audio.

          AIGA & Hue is a desktop web experience that visualizes career data

          The recent over-saturation of interest in certain design fields has
          resulted in skewed perceptions of neighboring creative industries.
          This project strives to break those stereotypes by providing a

          Rich, engaging conversation is a hallmark of meaningful human-to-human
          interaction. However, factors such as relational closeness, social
          formalities, and insecurities often hinder unfamiliar individuals from
